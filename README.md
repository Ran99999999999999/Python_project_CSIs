# Python_project_CSIs

This Python project uses the langdetect module (see pip install instructions) to help us identify the language that has been entered. This can be really useful if you’re unsure which language you’re dealing with. 
Note that the results returned by langdetect are abbreviated language codes. For example, if we enter English text, we will see ‘en’ as the return value.
